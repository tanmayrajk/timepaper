-   `options/type` - the progress that the progress bar will measure. could be set to the following - `year, month, day, hour, minute`
-   `options/theme` - the theme you want to select from the `themes`.
-   `options/width` - width of the inside fill of the progress bar in pixels.
-   `options/height` - height of the inside fill of the progress bar in pixels.

## warning

for some reason, setting the wallpaper causes a lot of things to refresh (in windows atleast), and so refreshing every second can cause a lot of things to become unsuable, therefore, it's not reccomended to set the refresh to `1`.
